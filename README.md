# Hey, I'm Faizan 👋

🌐 Frontend Developer (in the making) | 🎨 CSS appreciator | 🧠 BCA Student  
Building a solid foundation in web development, one line of code and one *what-the-heck-is-this-error* at a time.

### 💻 About Me

- 🎓 Currently studying **BCA (4th Semester)**  
- 🛠 Fluent in:  
  - **HTML / CSS** (making things look ✨aesthetic✨)  
  - **JavaScript** (basic JS ninja moves)  
  - **C++** (OG love, not forgotten)  
- 🧩 Strengthening core concepts before jumping into frameworks like **React**  
- 🛠️ Exploring how to turn simple ideas into visually clean, functional websites

---

### 🔧 Skills So Far

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic), C++  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub  
- **Currently Learning:** JavaScript deeply (like… really understanding it)

---

### 🧪 Projects

Still in my “building the basics” phase.  
Right now, I’m experimenting with:

- Simple **interactive webpages**
- Practicing layouts, animations, and clean design  
- Playing with **vanilla JavaScript** to build real stuff without relying on frameworks (yet)

More to come as I build, break, and rebuild things 🚧

---

### 🧠 Learning Style

- Hands-on > watching tutorials forever  
- Prefer simple code that just works  
- Big fan of figuring things out by *actually doing* — not spoon-feeding, but trial and (many) errors

### ✨ A Bit of Realness

I’m not a prodigy. Not a tutorial junkie either.  
Just someone trying to **understand code deeply** instead of faking progress.  
Started from scratch more times than I can count, but hey, that's part of it.
